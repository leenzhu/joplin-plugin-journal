## Manual

1. Click `Tools` -> `Journal` -> `Open Today's Note` to open a note for today. If the note does not exist, it be will be created as a new note. Default keyboard shortcut is `Ctrl+Alt+D`.
2. Click `Tools` -> `Journal` -> `Open Another day's Note`, to open a calendar to choose a date to journal. Default keyboard shortcut is `Ctrl+Alt+O`.
3. Click `Tools` -> `Journal` -> `Insert a link to Today's Note` to insert a reference link to today's note. If the note does not exist, it will be created. Default keyboard shortcut is `Ctrl+Alt+L`.
4. Click `Tools` -> `Journal` -> `Insert a link to Another day's Note` to insert a reference link to another day's note. If the note does not exist, it will be created. Default keyboard shortcut is `Ctrl+Alt+T`.
5. Every option above with `Today` also has a version with an offset. You can set the offset in the settings, which will shift the end of the day by up to 6 hours in either direction. This is useful if you often create the note for the previous day after midnight or the note for the following day before midnight. Default shortcuts are the same as above with an additional `Shift`.

You can customize the keyboard shortcuts via `Tools` -> `Options` -> `Keyboard shortcuts`, and then using `journal` in the search box to filter the keyboard shortcuts for the Journal plugin.

## Known issues

If you create the same note (a note with the same title and in the same folder) too quickly, a duplicate note will be created with the same name.

When using the default shortcut `Ctrl+Alt+D` to create today's note, you should wait more than 10 seconds before using the shortcut again, or it will create a duplicate note. This is because Joplin needs around 10 seconds to build the note's index - it should be found after about 10 seconds.
